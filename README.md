## Project Objectives
To help Rockbuster management identify:
- Which movies contribute most/least to revenue  
- The average rental duration across films  
- Where high-value customers are located  
- Regional differences in sales performance  


## Data Context
The data set includes:
- Customer demographics  
- Film inventory and categories  
- Payments and rental details  

Data was loaded into PostgreSQL and analyzed using **SQL** through **pgAdmin4**.


## Key Analyses & Queries
- **Revenue Insights:** Ranking movies by total earnings  
- **Customer Geography:** Mapping customer locations and high-value regions  
- **Rental Trends:** Calculating average rental durations and frequencies  
- **Regional Performance:** Comparing sales by region  

Each query was documented and visualized to support clear, actionable insights.


## Learning Outcomes
- Writing complex SQL queries (JOINs, CTEs, Subqueries)  
- Data cleaning and summarization using SQL functions  
- Creating data dictionaries and visual reports for stakeholders  
- Presenting analytical findings to both business and technical audiences  


## Tools & Technologies
- **PostgreSQL**
- **pgAdmin 4**
- **Excel / Tableau (for visualization)**
- **SQL (PostgreSQL) (CRUD, Joins, Aggregations, CTEs)**


## Stakeholders
- **VP of Marketing:** Seeks better targeting for campaigns  
- **SVP of Sales:** Focused on improving low-performing sectors  
- **Customers:** Want personalized recommendations and offers  


## Analysis Approach
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding data structure and relationships
- **Cleaning**: Checking for missing or duplicate values
- **Joins & Aggregations**: Combining multiple tables (rental, customer, film, payment, etc.)
- **KPIs**: Calculating revenue by country, top customers, film categories, and rental durations
- **Visualization**: Building charts and dashboards in Tableau to communicate results


## Data Ethics
All analysis was conducted with attention to privacy and responsible data handling.
Customer data used for this project is fictional and provided solely for educational purposes.


## Data Source
Data provided by CareerFoundry and based on Rockbusterâ€™s internal dataset (approx. 3 MB).
